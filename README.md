# Project--R-6

<table>

  This story was the subject of the book Moneyball, written by the legendary author Michael Lewis. The main premise is that what common knowledge suggests about how to succeed in sports, specially in the MLB, is not always correct. Metrics like stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average are known and respected by everyone. Measurements like on-base percentage and slugging percentage, however, are not usually thought of as better indicators of offensive success, but that’s exactly what the A’s were looking for.

In this project, we will recreate the story of the 2002 Oakland A’s and see if we, with the power of data analysis and R, can find the players that can replace the stars that left them the year before.</br>
